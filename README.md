# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-Player
Developed an AI which plays optimally with a losing rate of 0% using Minimax algorithm

Designed an interactive GUI using Pygame to play against the AI

Since Tic-Tac-Toe is a tie given optimal play by both sides, you cannot beat the AI (though if you donâ€™t play optimally as well, it may beat you!)
